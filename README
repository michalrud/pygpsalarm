So, i hope this will grow up to be a simple alarm clock that will wake me up on the bus, so I won't miss my stop anymore.

The idea comes from inap for iPhone, but this one won't cost anything ;) I saw this app on Gizmoto ant thought "hey, it could be done in Python!". So here we are, and I hope I won't abandon this project... Anyway, I find it useful by myself.

So, to be official:
